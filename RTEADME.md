# (Bun + Nitro + i18next) crash Example

1. bun install
2. bun prisma db push
3. bun run dev

Try changing any file, or routing file, try several times, the crash is unstable, sometimes it crashes after a few edits, sometimes it takes many times. In addition, I still verified that when removing i18next, it will not crash even if I use dev work for a day.
